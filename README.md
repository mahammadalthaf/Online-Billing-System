Hotel Online Billing

This is a java program for online hotel booking and I have considered major user inputs like the name of a customer, type of room he/she wants, number of extra persons and number of days wants to stay in hotel. User will give the input from console if the type of room, number of extra persons and stay days doesnâ€™t matches with conditions then particular error will be prompted on the console so for that, I have taken the abstract methods in my interface class and implemented them in main class and I have created a tester class to test my cases  and I took the user inputs if input matches all the conditions then bill will be calculated according to the input and it will be showed on the console.
